**CONSUMABLES** -  Bonus Action for self, Full action for another player.

**Alternative** - if you use a full action to heal, you recover the full hp amount of the consumable.

  

**FIRST LEVEL FEAT** - At first level, select a starting Feat!

**HIDDEN DEATH SAVES** - When a player character drops to 0 hp, the dungeon master rolls the death saves for that character in secret. TENSION BUILDER!!

**ZERO HP EXHAUSTION** - When a player character drops to 0 hp, they also gain a level of exhaustion.

**CRITICAL FAIL** - Critical fails on attack rolls against targets in melee range may provoke an opportunity attack from that target using their reaction. Rolled on Fumble Table as 95-100%

**INITIATIVE ORDER** - Highest goes first, but higher can delay turn to allow teammate to go first.

**RULE OF COOL** - If a player wants their character to do something that is outside of the usual rules of the game, they can suggest it to the DM who may accept it, deny it, or accept it with caveats.

**FLANKING BONUS** - Allow flanking, which is you and an ally on opposite sides of an enemy during melee -  this allows a simple +2 TO HIT. Applies to enemy attacks on you, as well!

HELP ACTION - SKILL CHECKS - To aid in a Non Combat skill check, the helper must have a positive modifier in the skill and then the helper may add their proficiency bonus to the roll.

INSPIRATION - Each player has one token to award per session to another player when they decide a cool thing was done/inspired or great RP occurred. May accrue no more than 3 at a time! we will seek to mark these on the token status bars for your character token as the golden box.

EXHAUSTION FOR SPELL SLOTS -  There are times when a long rest just does not come, and characters’ resources are pushed to their absolute limit. Essentially, players are allowed to use their exhaustion levels in place of their spell slots. Level for Level up to 5, with 6 obviously being dead.
