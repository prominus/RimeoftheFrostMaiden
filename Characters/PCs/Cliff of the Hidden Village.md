## About the Realm

In the world of Faerûn, the dragons of lore are few and far between.  Most lost to the [Rage of Dragons](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rage_of_Dragons) eons ago.  The deities of the [Draconic Pantheon](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Draconic_pantheon) abandoned and forgotten.  

In the mirror sister world of [Abier](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abeir), there be dragons a plenty.  Frequently warring and interacting with fellow dragons along with the smaller beings like dragonborn, dwarves, and humans.  The Gods of dragon kind are known to some, prayed too, and reached out for in efforts to keep the balance between dragon and non-dragon alike.

Cliff, until the recently, was counted among dragon kin of this realm.  A gem drangonborn reigning form the mineral rich mountains outside of **Marranth**.  

Nestled in the heights of the Marranthian mountains lies a secretive settlemtn known as Houpetor Shirpon. The Hidden Village.  A village purposefully isolated for safety from the ever waring dragons surrounding it.
## About the Hidden Village

While all deities of the draconic pantheon are worshiped, the primary deity of worship is the god that inspired the secrecy of the Hidden Village, [Sardior](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sardior).  This village is inhabited by a few hundred citizens. Mostly gem dragonborn (90%) followed by a small number of chromatic and metallic dragonborn who align with Sardior's ideology (8%) and a holdout of dwarves who help with the shallow mining for gems and minerals into the mountains (2%). Anyone from the clan is allowed to leave, but most do not unless they are deemed worthy to be a guide for the Hidden Village (more info below).

The inhabitants of Hidden Village consider themselves to be a clan of one.  Eggs of new dragonborn are all placed in the same rookery. The clan are the parents to all children, and all children of the clan are siblings.  While the dwarves do their best to fit in with the culture of the Hidden Village, there is some underlying tension due to the biological difference between the races.  For instance, the dwarven biological parents take on the guardian roles of their offspring as seen more commonly in other locations.

The Hidden Village takes large efforts to keep their village location secret.  There are a group of sage wise ones, deemed by the court of Sardior, to be the ambassador of secrets between the court and realm of Abier.  These sages, deemed the most adapt at trading in secrets, are the only ones who know the circuitous routes in and out of the Hidden village. They oversee the transportation of merchants and goods to and from the town. Bind folding anyone not privy to the village whereabouts at certain points in the path. Members of this group are also responsible for walking outside in the greater world. Looking for those wishing to find the Hidden Village to either live in and follow the ways of Sardior and his court, or to reach out to the court in search of hidden answers. 

Prior to the events of described in the next section, Cliff intended to prove himself worthy to possess the secret pathways to the Hidden Village so that he might venture as a village guide and representative to the larger world.  Being middleman for trade, finding out secrets worthy to pass to the sages of Sardior, and aiding those back to the village to seek out guidance from the sages and wise ones.

## Cliff's Backstory

Cliff was an acolyte under the sages of [Sardior](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Sardior) and follower of Sardior's thane, [Smargard](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Smargad).  Drawn to the master of secrets in hopes to emulate Smargard's skill.  Cliff often wondered at the world at large.  He hoped a day would come that his skills at trading in secrets would prove worthy enough to be a guide/representative of the village. 

However, outside of quiet comfortable life of the Hidden Village larger powers were at play.  Members of Sardior's Court whispered of secret plots underfoot in the Fey Wilds and Outer Planes. Oracles peering into the muddied waters of the future felt a strong sense of foreboding.  As if the realms were on a knife's edge between peace or inter planar conflict.

Wary of repercussions this external threat may pose to the village, the sages of the Hidden Village took action to increase their prayers to the Ruby Court. They hoped that enough foresight and gained boons would prepare them of events to come.

In the late hours of night, where secretive things are best done, the sages of Smargard and their acolytes began performing a ritual to Sardior and the Ruby Court. In the height of this ritual, after providing sufficient prayers and and gifts of found secrets to the gods, those prayers were answered. Given the floating Ruby Palace's abilities to travel the court of Sardior began to shift reality between the planes.  The metaphysical distance between the realms of Abier and the Ruby Palace thinned to the point of overlap.  At the pinnacle of this overlap, as boons were being provided to the sages and followers of the Hidden Village, is when adversaries of Ruby Palace attacked (see **Enemies of the Ruby Palace** for ideas).

Taking advantage of the planar turmoil underfoot, these enemies performed a surprise strike on the Ruby court. Unfortunate to the Hidden Village, they were bystanders to this attack.  A stray explosion from the adversaries caused a palace wall to break open to the skies, and most of the members of the Hidden Village, including Cliff, were ejected out to the endless sky.  Cliff having just taken the brunt of an explosion soon passed out. Looking first at his falling kin, then up at the increasingly distant floating castle as everything went to black.

Cliff later woke up to several surprises. First surprise being still alive. Second, being alive and alone. Third, being alive, alone, and waking up in a pile of snow surrounded by endless twilight.  Final was the the sensation of arcane and psionic energy flowing through him, and somehow knowing despite just how sideways events had gone during the ritual, Cliff came out with a boon from the gods.

## Spy for the harpers

Cliff realized that if he did not seek shelter from the cold he would not live long to make good on any received boon. At this point Cliff assumed he was transported somewhere else in Abier.  After some trials of survival, Cliff did find a village, and soon made some observations.  First that this there was more to his relocation than he initially thought as odd looks were given to the currency Cliff tried to use to purchase some food and supplies from a local merchant.  The second, and most stunning to Cliff, was the sight of a high elf talking casually in a crowd of humans and humanoids.

In Abier, the only known elves are the dark elves from [Abieran Underdark](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Abeiran_Underdark). Cliff was amazed and enchanted at how a wicked pale drow could walk so freely and friendly with others humans and humanoids.  This curiosity had Cliff start to inquiry others to find out more info on this elf, and where he truly was to have elves that were seemingly not malicious.  Unbeknownst to Cliff, this high elf was a ranking member of the Harpers. While Cliff assumed his inquiries of the elf were discrete enough. They were not for a member as adapt at observation, with as broad of a spy network.

In isolation from crowds of the town, the high elf, [[Daylin Balwork]] confronted Cliff as to why he seemed so keen on learning more about them. Cliff attempted to spin elaborate flattery and falsities for justification of his inquiries, but the the elf skilled at reading others was not foold. Instead, they assessed the dragonborn's mannerisms and phrasings and comparing it with their knowledge of the few gem dragonborn of the realm. They quickly ascertained that Cliff was more than just an outsider to Icewind Dale, and reproached Cliff to try answering again but with the truth this time.

Cliff to admitted the truth of how he arrived, and his endeavor to find the kin which were ejected from the Ruby Palace. Upon hearing the true story, the high elf determined that Cliff could be a useful ally for the Harper cause, and came up to an arrangement to have his spy network seek out information on the whereabouts of the lost members of the Hidden Village. In exchange, Cliff would pass along useful information to the informants and be ready to take on tasks passed to him by the Harpers.

## Enemies of the Ruby Palace

I initially picked the Ruby Palace to be attacked by some primordial force due to the events that occurred in Waterdeep in the last campaign, along with an ancient primordial, [Erek-Hus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Erek-Hus), having been rivals and the eventual slayer of the dragon god IO.  Maybe a faction of the primordial forces that were sympathetic to Erek-Hus' cause made a play as the barrier between realms was thinned?

The attacking enemies could also be [Obsidian Dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLD0FQzVjxM&t=796s) as this group of gem dragon kin had been banished from the Ruby Palace long ago for mysterious reasons.  Maybe the banishment was just, or maybe not. Perhaps regardless of the validation Sardior had in banishment the group of obsidian dragons in the fire plane held a grudge, and decided to use maelstrom events to get retribution.

These are the two main ideas I have, but it could also be a faction from the Fey Wilds or other Plane looking to set off certain events to merge Toril and Abier back together.  Really, doesn't matter to me the who if there is a decent justification.

## Cliff's internal secret

Cliff's main focus is to find his kin and get them safely back home if possible. However, something he has not come to terms with is that he actually doesn't want to return home.  While there is certainly dangers to be had in Icewind Dale with the extreme cold and eternal twilight, the freedom of movement provided to him is like none he ever experienced in the quite isolated village. For his whole life Cliff had always been part of a clan, looking to do what was best for the clan first.  Here, he is much more independent, and that brings him both joy and shame.
