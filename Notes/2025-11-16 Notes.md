Starting in the town of [[Bryn Shander]].  One of the towns that does human sacrifices

## Sacrifices to Auril

![[Pasted image 20251116190118.png]]

The desperate people of Ten-Towns, hoping to appease Auril so that summer can return to Icewind Dale, make sacrifices to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is a new practice that started a little over 5 months ago, when it became clear that Auril was angry   
and summer would not be returning anytime soon. We start on Kythorn 9, 1493.

Humanoid - [[Bryn Shander]], [[Easthaven]], and [[Targos]] hold lotteries the afternoon before the new moon. The unlucky person whose name is drawn is sacrificed at nightfall. The ill-fated soul is stripped bare and either tied to a post or sent into the tundra to die. Accusations of rigged lotteries are common but usually not acted upon. 

Food - Smaller towns that can't afford to give up people give up their food instead. A day's catch of knucklehead trout is strung up on wooden racks a mile outside town, to be claimed by yeti and other creatures that embody [[Auril]]'s wrath. 

Warmth - Towns that can't bring themselves to give up their people or their food forsake warmth for a night. No fires are lit between dusk and dawn, forcing locals to share body heat for warmth. Anyone who dares to light a fire is savagely beaten.

## Risk of Avalanche

![[Pasted image 20251116190025.png]]

#### ﻿An avalanche is a mass of snow and debris falling   
rapidly down a mountainside. A typical avalanche is 300   
feet wide, 150 feet long, and 30 feet thick. Creatures   
in the path of an avalanche can avoid it or escape it if   
they're close to its edge, but outrunning one is almost   
impossible.   
When an avalanche occurs, all nearby creatures must   
roll initiative. Twice each round, on initiative counts 10   
and 0, the avalanche travels 300 feet until it can travel   
no more. When an avalanche moves, any creature in its   
space moves along with it and falls prone, and the creature

#### must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw, suffering 1d10

#### bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as   
much damage on a successful one. 

####   
When an avalanche stops, the snow settles and buries   
creatures in it. A creature buried in this way is blinded   
and restrained and has total cover. The creature gains   
one level of exhaustion for every 5 minutes it spends   
buried in the snow. It can try to dig itself free as an action,

#### breaking the surface and ending the blinded and   
restrained conditions on itself with a successful DC   
15 Strength (Athletics) check. A creature that fails this   
check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again.   
A creature that is not restrained or incapacitated can   
spend 1 minute freeing another creature buried in the   
snow. Once free, that creature is no longer blinded or   
restrained by the avalanche.

### Risk of Blizzard

![[Pasted image 20251116185902.png]]
#### A blizzard in Icewind Dale typically lasts 2d4 hours,

#### and whenever the characters are caught in one, the following

#### rules apply until it ends. 

####   
A blizzard's howling wind limits hearing to a range of   
100 feet and imposes disadvantage on ranged weapon   
attack rolls. It also imposes disadvantage on Wisdom   
(Perception) checks that rely on hearing. The wind extinguishes

#### open flames, disperses fog, erases tracks in the snow, and makes

#### flying by nonmagical means nearly impossible. A creature falls at

#### the end of its turn if it is flying by nonmagical means and can't hover. 

####   

#### Visibility in a blizzard is reduced to 30 feet. Creatures   
without goggles or other eye protection have disadvantage on

#### Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight   
due to blowing snow. 

####   
Any creature that is concentrating on a spell in a   
blizzard must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving   
throw at the end of its turn or lose its concentration on   
the spell unless the creature is sheltered against the elements

#### (for example, in an igloo). 

####   

#### If the characters travel during a blizzard, have the   
players designate one party member as the navigator.   
At the end of each hour of travel through the blizzard,   
the DM makes a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check on   
behalf of the navigator. On a successful check, the party   
stays on course. On a failed check, the party wanders   
off course, putting its members no closer to their destination

#### than they were at the start of that hour. If the   
check fails by 5 or more and the party members aren't   
tied together, one randomly determined party member   
becomes lost in the blizzard and separated from the   
others.

####   

#### If the group tries to reunite with its missing   
member, have the party members (including the missing   
one) make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) group check at   
the end of each hour. If this group check succeeds, the   
missing party member is found, but no progress is made   
toward reaching the group's intended destination that   
hour. The group check can be repeated after each hour   
spent searching for the missing party member.

### Extreme Cold
![[Pasted image 20251116185935.png]]

#### A creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC   
10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or   
gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance   
or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on   
the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather   
clothing (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures   
naturally adapted to cold climates, such as reindeer and   
snowy owlbears. 

#### Temperatures. During Auril's everlasting winter, the   
average temperature in Icewind Dale is -49 degrees   
Fahrenheit (-45 degrees Celsius). Wind chill can lower   
these temperatures by as much as 80 degrees.

### Frigid Water
![[Pasted image 20251116190004.png]]
#### A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.

####   

#### Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in icecold water.

### Illumination

![[Pasted image 20251116190159.png]]

### So long as the Everlasting Rime lasts, natural light in Icewind Dale is never brighter than dim. In normal (non-blizzard) conditions, twilight extends from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Icewind Dale is otherwise dark until Auril's aurora or the full moon appears in the night sky. 

###   
If you have Darkvision, you can see in [Dim Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#DimLight) within a specified range as if it were [Bright Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#BrightLight) and in [Darkness](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Darkness) within that range as if it were Dim Light. You discern colors in that Darkness only as shades of gray.

### An area with Dim Light is Lightly Obscured.You have [Disadvantage](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Disadvantage) on Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/free-rules/playing-the-game#Skills)) checks to see something in a Lightly Obscured space.

## Overland Travel
![[Pasted image 20251116190308.png]]

Times above are walking with snowshoes. 

The fastest way to travel across the tundra is by dogsled (see "Getting Around Ten-Towns," page 20). But dogs are expensive and require food, water, and shelter. Unless they have more equipment than they can carry, adventurers are better off traveling on foot. 

---
The speed that characters can travel across Icewind Dale's rough, snowy tundra is given in the Overland Travel table. Travel is less time-consuming on the snowy roads and trails that connect the settlements of Ten Towns.

---

| Travel                   | Distance |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Dogsled                  | 1 mile   |
| On foot, w/snowshoes     | 1/2 mile |
| On foot, w/out snowshoes | 1/4 mile |

## Mountain Travel

Navigating the Spine of the World or the slopes of Kelvin's Cairn is particularly arduous because of the unforgiving mountain terrain. At the end of each hour, the character or NPC leading the expedition must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. On a successful check, the hour's journey was not hindered by weather or terrain.

---

On a failed check, the party comes to an impasse and must backtrack, which costs an extra hour   
of travel. If the check fails by 5 or more, the party is caught in an avalanche as it backtracks. The avalanche starts 2d6 x 100 feet above the characters.

---   

The Mountain Travel table shows how fast the characters can move through the mountains on foot or by dogsled. Even in the best of cases, a journey in the mountains takes twice as long as one of the same distance   
across the tundra. 

| Travel                   | Distance |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Dogsled                  | 1/2 mile |
| On foot, w/snowshoes     | 1/4 mile |
| On foot, w/out snowshoes | 1/8 mile |

## Fishing for Knucklehead Trout

![[Pasted image 20251116190600.png]]

#### To fish for knucklehead trout on the lakes of Icewind   
Dale, a character needs fishing tackle and a rowboat.   
The former costs 4 gp (per the Player's Handbook),   
while the latter can be bought for 50 gp or rented for 2   
gp per day. A character can fish on the ice instead of a   
boat, in which case a saw or similar tool is needed to cut   
a fishing hole through the ice.   
At the end of each hour spent fishing on the lake,   
the character must make a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival)   
check. A failed check indicates no fish is caught during   
that hour. If the check succeeds, the character hooks a   
knucklehead trout (see appendix C)

## Actual Introduction

### Lantern of Tracking

![[Pasted image 20251116202401.png]]
## _Wondrous item, common_

This hooded lantern burns for 12 hours on 1 pint of magical oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. While the lantern is within 300 feet of any creature it is attuned to, its flame turns bright green. The lantern doesn't pinpoint the creature's exact location.

Specific magical oils, enhanced with divination magic, are used to power this object. Once an oil is used in the lantern, it must be either disposed of or burnt before another can be put in.

The lantern can act as a normal hooded lantern using regular oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Each pint of normal oil lasts 6 hours.

### On the road to Targos

Overcast and cloudy.  See the stars.  See twisting green ribbon across the sky representing the aura that is being created by [[Auril]]'s spell.

Any deciduous trees that did exist have long since died. Some that were hearty would have just gone dormant.  All of those trees are just husks. See small dregs of dead grass in spots.

Walking holding hands with [[Stronk]].  [[Stronk]] shares the various barks to gather for fire.  [[Cliff of the Hidden Village|Cliff]] asks about the father honorific.  They share how offspring are handled.
