##### The first stop for most visitors to Icewind Dale is Bryn   
Shander, a walled town perched atop a cold, lonely,   
wind-lashed hill. Bright lanterns suspended over narrow   
streets twist in the wind and add flecks of color to the   
town's otherwise drab surroundings. 

##### The friendliness in this settlement has dwindled of   
late. Auril's unyielding winter has greatly reduced the   
number of visitors to Bryn Shand er, and local trade is   
suffering for it, eating away at the locals' sense of humor   
and goodwill. Still, there is no safer place in Icewind   
Dale to spend coin or spend the night. 

#####   
The walls of the town stand some 30 feet high and are   
defined by two concentric rings of upright wooden poles,   
the gap between them filled with dirt and rubble. The   
outer ring of poles rises above the top of the wall, providing a

##### rampart for defenders stationed on the woodplanked walkway.

##### The wall's hinged gates are 15 feet tall and can be barred from the inside with iron-banded   
wood beams. These gates are closed when it's dark outside-which is to say more often than not. 

#####   

##### Population. 1,200. 

##### Leaders. Speaker Duvessa Shane speaks for the townsfolk. Though relatively   
young, Duvessa is the head of the Council of Speakers.

#####   

##### Sheriff Markham Southwell  commands the militia. 

##### Militia. Bryn Shander can muster up to 250 soldiers and 20 veterans. 

#####   

##### Heraldry. Black antlers above a vertical shaft of golden   
wheat on a white field, signifying the town's strength   
and prosperity on the vast, snowy tundra. 

##### Sacrifice to Auril. Humanoid (see page 21).   
Rivalries. None.
