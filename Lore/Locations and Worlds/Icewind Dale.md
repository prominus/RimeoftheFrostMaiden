Perpetual dark winter of dark reprieve.  Goddess [[Auril]] has gone to live with mortals.  Put a spell.  Each night on midnight takes to the sky on a roc,  shimmering aura of light.  This magic prevents the next day sun from rising above the horizon.  

The Desperate people of [[10 towns]] make desperate sacrifices to the nights of the new moon. 5 months ago when clear that [[Auril]] is angry.

Starting the month of Kythorn.  Kythorn also goes by the time of flowers. Basically a June.

The desperate people of Ten-Towns, hoping to appease [[Auril]] so that summer can return to Icewind Dale, make sacrifices to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is a new practice that started a little over 5 months ago, when it became clear that [[Auril]] was angry   
and summer would not be returning anytime soon. **We start on Kythorn 9, 1493**.


Humanoid - [[Bryn Shander]], [[Easthaven]], and [[Targos]] hold lotteries the afternoon before the new moon. The unlucky person whose name is drawn is sacrificed at nightfall. The ill-fated soul is stripped bare and either tied to a post or sent into the tundra to die. Accusations of rigged lotteries are common but usually not acted upon. 

Food - Smaller towns that can't afford to give up people give up their food instead. A day's catch of knucklehead trout is strung up on wooden racks a mile outside town, to be claimed by yeti and other creatures that embody Auril's wrath. 

 Warmth - Towns that can't bring themselves to give up their people or their food forsake warmth for a night. No fires are lit between dusk and dawn, forcing locals to share body heat for warmth. Anyone who dares to light a fire is savagely beaten.
