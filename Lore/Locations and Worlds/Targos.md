#### Like Bryn Shander, Targos is encircled by a wooden   
wall, which helps to protect the town against orcs and   
other threats from the wilderness. The wall extends out   
into the lake, creating a safe harbor for the town's boats.   
But now Auril's long winter has frozen the water in the   
harbor, and many ofTargos's boats are trapped in the   
ice. Fishers must drag their smaller vessels across the   
ice to get to the unfrozen lake beyond the harbor walls.   
Almost all the towns in lcewind Dale make their living   
off the lakes, but nowhere is that fact more evident than   
in Targos. The town has always had the biggest fishing   
fleet and the biggest fishing industry, and everything   
that goes on here revolves around hauling the knucklehead trout out of Maer Dualdon. Auril's endless winter makes the work harder, but it gets done nonetheless. 

#### Naerth Maxildanarr, a former rogue of Luskan, moved   
to Targos a couple of years ago, took up residence in the   
Luskan Arms, and spread around a lot of gold, earning   
the loyalty of many local fishers.
